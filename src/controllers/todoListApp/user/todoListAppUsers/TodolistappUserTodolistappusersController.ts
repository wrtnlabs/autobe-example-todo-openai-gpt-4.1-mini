   * identified by their unique UUID. It retrieves the user's email, email
   * verification status, and timestamps related to when the account was
   * created, last updated, and deleted (if soft deleted).
   *
   * Security considerations require that only authorized roles can access this
   * endpoint since it exposes sensitive authentication data. The password hash
   * field is excluded to prevent exposure of sensitive information.
   *
   * The operation tightly couples with the todo_list_app_users table in the
   * Prisma schema ensuring that the exact fields and data integrity rules are
   * respected. It returns a complete user object matching the schema
   * properties, excluding sensitive password data.
   *
   * Typical errors include attempting to fetch a user ID that does not exist,
   * which should return a not-found error. Unauthorized access attempts should
   * be rejected with a 403 or similar error.
   *
   * This operation is distinct from list or update operations and serves as a
   * granular user data retrieval endpoint, often supporting administrative or
   * account management UI features.
