# Non-Functional Requirements for Todo List Application

This document defines the non-functional requirements of the Todo List application backend service. It provides a clear and comprehensive description of security, privacy, performance, scalability, backup, recovery, monitoring, and logging needs to guide backend developers in implementation. This document specifies WHAT the system must achieve without dictating HOW to implement the solutions.

---

## 1. Security Requirements

### 1.1 Authentication and Access Control
- WHEN a user attempts to authenticate, THE system SHALL validate credentials securely and respond within 2 seconds.
- THE system SHALL use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to manage user sessions following the roles defined in the user roles document.
- THE system SHALL expire access tokens after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- THE system SHALL provide mechanisms to revoke tokens immediately upon user request.
- THE system SHALL limit access based on user roles: 'guest', 'user', and 'admin' with permissions as defined.
- IF an unauthorized access attempt occurs, THEN THE system SHALL log the attempt and deny access with appropriate error messages.

### 1.2 Data Encryption
- THE system SHALL encrypt all sensitive user data at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- THE system SHALL encrypt all data transmitted between client and server using TLS 1.2 or higher.

### 1.3 Vulnerability Management
- THE system SHALL undergo automated security scans weekly.
- THE system SHALL apply security patches within 48 hours of release.
- IF a security breach is detected, THEN THE system SHALL notify administrators immediately and trigger a containment process.

---

## 2. Privacy and Compliance

### 2.1 User Data Protection
- THE system SHALL store personally identifiable information (PII) securely, limiting access to authorized roles only.
- THE system SHALL comply with relevant data protection regulations applicable to the user base.

### 2.2 Compliance with Standards and Laws
- THE system SHALL log consent for data use according to applicable legal requirements.
- THE system SHALL support user requests for data export and deletion within 5 business days.

---

## 3. Performance Requirements

### 3.1 Response Time
- WHEN a user creates, reads, updates, or deletes a todo item, THE system SHALL complete the operation with a response time of less than 1 second under normal load conditions.
- WHERE the system is under heavy load (up to 1000 concurrent users), THE system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds.

### 3.2 Throughput
- THE system SHALL support at least 100 todo item operations per second without degradation.

### 3.3 Concurrency Handling
- THE system SHALL handle concurrent updates to the same todo item by enforcing optimistic locking and informing the user of conflicts.

---

## 4. Scalability and Availability

### 4.1 Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- THE system SHALL support horizontal scaling to add more instances during peak usage.
- THE system SHALL allow vertical scaling by increasing resources on existing nodes.

### 4.2 High Availability
- THE system SHALL maintain an availability of 99.9% uptime monthly.
- THE system SHALL detect node failures and reroute traffic to healthy instances within 1 minute.

### 4.3 Load Balancing
- THE system SHALL distribute incoming requests evenly across all available instances.

---

## 5. Backup and Recovery

### 5.1 Backup Policy
- THE system SHALL perform full backups daily and incremental backups hourly.
- BACKUPS SHALL be retained for a minimum of 30 days.

### 5.2 Recovery Procedures
- THE system SHALL support recovery of data from backups to a point not older than 15 minutes from failure time.
- THE system SHALL verify backup integrity weekly.

---

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

### 6.1 System Monitoring
- THE system SHALL continuously monitor availability, CPU, memory usage, and disk space.
- THE system SHALL alert administrators when any metric crosses predefined thresholds.

### 6.2 Logging Requirements
- THE system SHALL log all significant events, including authentication attempts, CRUD operations, and system errors.
- LOGS SHALL be retained for at least 90 days.
- THE system SHALL ensure logs are tamper-evident and access-controlled.

### 6.3 Alerting
- THE system SHALL send critical alerts via email and SMS to administrators within 5 minutes of detection.

## Summary
This document provides only the business-oriented non-functional requirements of the Todo List application backend. All technical implementation details, such as architecture, frameworks, database design, and APIs, are at the discretion of the development team.

These requirements ensure that the Todo list application is secure, compliant, responsive, scalable, and maintainable to meet business and user expectations.
