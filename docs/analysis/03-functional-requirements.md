# Todo List Application - Functional Requirements Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the business functional requirements for the todoListApp backend. The application supports a minimal todo list feature set allowing authenticated users to manage their own list of todo items through creation, retrieval, update, and deletion operations.

The system supports a single user role: "user". Each user has exclusive access to their own todo items. This document uses the EARS format for clarity and testability.

## 2. Todo Item Lifecycle

### 2.1 Create Todo Item
WHEN a user submits a request to create a new todo item with a description, THE system SHALL validate the description and create a todo item with a unique identifier and status "pending".

Business rules:
- The description SHALL be a non-empty string with a maximum length of 256 characters.
- The created todo item SHALL be associated exclusively with the creating user.
- The todo item status SHALL initially be "pending".

### 2.2 Retrieve Todo List
WHEN a user requests to view their todo list, THE system SHALL return all todo items owned by that user ordered by creation timestamp ascending.

### 2.3 Update Todo Item
WHEN a user requests to mark a todo item as done, THE system SHALL verify ownership and update its status to "done".

WHEN a user requests to edit the description of a todo item, THE system SHALL verify that the item is in "pending" state and owned by the user, then update the description.

### 2.4 Delete Todo Item
WHEN a user requests deletion of a todo item, THE system SHALL verify ownership and remove the todo item.

## 3. User Actions
- Add a new todo item with a description.
- Retrieve the user's complete todo list.
- Mark a todo item as done.
- Edit a pending todo item's description.
- Delete a todo item.

## 4. Business Rules
- Users SHALL only access and modify their own todo items.
- Todo item descriptions SHALL be validated for length and non-empty status.
- Todo item status field SHALL only have values "pending" or "done".
- IDs of todo items SHALL be unique per user.

## 5. Performance Expectations
- THE system SHALL respond to create, update, delete, and retrieval requests within 2 seconds (under typical load).
- Retrieval of up to 100 todo items SHALL complete within 1 second.

## 6. Error Handling
- IF a todo item creation request includes an invalid (empty or overly long) description, THEN THE system SHALL respond with an error indicating invalid input.
- IF a user attempts operations on todo items they do not own or that do not exist, THEN THE system SHALL respond with proper authorization error.
- IF unexpected system errors occur, THEN THE system SHALL return a generic failure message.
