# Todo List Application - Functional Requirements Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the business functional requirements for the todoListApp backend. The application supports a minimal todo list feature set allowing authenticated users to create, retrieve, update, and delete their own todo items. The system supports a single user role: "user", who has exclusive access to their own todo items. This document uses the EARS format for clarity and testability.

## 2. Todo Item Lifecycle

### 2.1 Create Todo Item
WHEN a user submits a request to create a new todo item with a description, THE system SHALL validate the description to be a non-empty string with a maximum length of 256 characters, THEN create a todo item with a unique identifier and initial status "pending" associated exclusively with the creating user.

### 2.2 Retrieve Todo List
WHEN a user requests to view their todo list, THE system SHALL return all todo items owned by that user ordered by creation timestamp ascending.

### 2.3 Update Todo Item
WHEN a user requests to mark a todo item as done, THE system SHALL verify ownership of the item by the requesting user, THEN update its status to "done".

WHEN a user requests to edit the description of a todo item, THE system SHALL verify that the item is in "pending" state and owned by the requesting user, THEN update the description to a new valid non-empty string with a maximum length of 256 characters.

### 2.4 Delete Todo Item
WHEN a user requests deletion of a todo item, THE system SHALL verify ownership of the item by the requesting user, THEN remove the todo item from the system.

## 3. User Actions
- Add a new todo item with a description.
- Retrieve the user's complete todo list.
- Mark a todo item as done.
- Edit a pending todo item's description.
- Delete a todo item.

## 4. Business Rules
- Users SHALL only access and modify their own todo items.
- Todo item descriptions SHALL be validated for length (max 256 characters) and non-empty status.
- Todo item status SHALL only have values "pending" or "done".
- Todo item identifiers SHALL be unique per user.

## 5. Performance Expectations
- THE system SHALL respond to create, update, delete, and retrieval requests within 2 seconds under normal operating conditions.
- THE system SHALL retrieve up to 100 todo items within 1 second.

## 6. Error Handling
- IF a todo item creation request includes an invalid description (empty or exceeding length), THEN THE system SHALL respond with a clear error message indicating invalid input and reject the creation.
- IF a user attempts to operate on a todo item they do not own or that does not exist, THEN THE system SHALL respond with an authorization or not found error as appropriate.
- IF an unexpected system error occurs, THEN THE system SHALL return a generic failure error message.
