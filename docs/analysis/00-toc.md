# Todo List Application - Functional Requirements Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This specification defines the complete set of functional requirements for the todoListApp backend. The system supports a single user role: "user," where each user can create, view, update, and delete their own todo items exclusively. The requirements employ the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) for clarity and testability, making all system behaviors explicit and verifiable.

The overall goal is to provide a minimal but fully functional todo list application backend that ensures secure and reliable management of personal task items.

## 2. Todo Item Lifecycle

### 2.1 Create Todo Item
WHEN a user submits a request to create a new todo item with a description, THE system SHALL validate the description according to the validation rules in section 4 and create a todo item associated exclusively with that user. The created todo item SHALL have a unique identifier and its status SHALL be set to "pending" initially.

### 2.2 Retrieve Todo List
WHEN a user requests to view their todo list, THE system SHALL return all todo items owned by that user ordered by their creation timestamp in ascending order.

### 2.3 Update Todo Item
WHEN a user requests to mark a todo item as done, THE system SHALL verify ownership of the item and update its status to "done".

WHEN a user requests to edit a todo item's description, THE system SHALL verify that the item is owned by the user and is currently in the "pending" status before updating the description.

### 2.4 Delete Todo Item
WHEN a user requests deletion of a todo item, THE system SHALL verify ownership and delete the item.

## 3. User Actions

- Add a new todo item by providing a description.
- Retrieve the full list of their todo items.
- Mark a specific todo item as done.
- Edit the description of a todo item currently in "pending" status.
- Delete a todo item.

## 4. Business Rules

- Task descriptions SHALL be non-empty strings with a maximum length of 256 characters.
- All todo items SHALL be associated with a single user who is the only one with access rights.
- Status of todo items SHALL only be "pending" or "done".
- Unique identifiers for todo items SHALL be unique per user and immutable.
- Users SHALL NOT be able to view, modify, or delete todo items belonging to other users.

## 5. Performance Expectations

- THE system SHALL respond to todo item creation, retrieval, update, and deletion requests within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
- THE retrieval of up to 100 todo items SHALL complete within 1 second.

## 6. Error Handling

- IF a todo item creation or update request contains an invalid description (empty or exceeding 256 characters), THEN THE system SHALL reject the request and respond with a descriptive validation error message.
- IF a user attempts to view or modify a todo item they do not own, THEN THE system SHALL reject the request with an authorization error.
- IF a requested todo item does not exist (e.g., invalid ID), THEN THE system SHALL respond with a not-found error message.
- IF an unexpected system error occurs, THEN THE system SHALL respond with a generic error message while logging the details internally.

The requirements are crafted exclusively as business rules using natural language and the EARS format, focusing on expected behaviors and constraints. The technical implementation details such as API protocols, database models, or internal system design are left to the development team to decide.
